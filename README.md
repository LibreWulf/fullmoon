Weechat Fullmoon Script
-----------------------

This is a simple little script that performs certain actions based on the change
of phases of the moon. More specifically, when the moon passes a certain
threshold of "fullness", the script will perform an action such as sending a
message to a channel and changing nick.  The moon phase data comes from (Weather
Underground)[http://wunderground.com] and is copyright them.

Not going to lie, this script exists solely because I wanted to make a joke
about my IRC nick.

Nothing but a stub on Github yet, I just pushed a basic shell since to get an
API key you need to give them a project URL. Actual script coming Soon(tm).
