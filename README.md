Weechat Fullmoon Script
=======================

This is a simple little script that performs certain actions based on the change
of phases of the moon. More specifically, when the moon passes a certain
threshold of "fullness" and once it's dark out, the script will perform an
action such as sending a message to a channel and changing nick. I was planning
on using some web API to get sunrise/sunset times and moon illumination data,
but I decided I could just do the calculations myself and save some bandwith.

Not going to lie, this script exists solely because I wanted to make a joke
about my IRC nick.

Status
------

Sunset time and moon phase calculation logic has been implemented, but the
script itself is still non functional.
